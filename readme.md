# Analysing Sentiments in Peer Review Reports: Evidence from Two Science Funding Agencies 

This repository contains the scripts written for an accompanying journal submission currently under review.
These are the scripts that generated the results, tables and figures contained in the paper. The original datafiles, including sentiment scores, review scores and review texts are not included in the repository, because part of these data cannot be shared.

The code is written for R-4.0.3 - the required libraries are indicated at the top of each script.
Two scripts are included:

## "import script.r"
This script imports the raw data files from different sources, cleans and normalizes the variables as needed, and merges them.
A second part of the script explores the data, and includes some of the analyses that were reported in the paper.

## "plots.r"
This script reproduces all plots shown in the paper.
